# A Variety of Cathedrals: A Liminal Space

The website has regrouped its conceptual fragments into a multimedia metaphorical essay on the mythological integration of faith in the psyche. This includes an interactive story (my autobiographical study of mythopoeia) and a 3d poetics/exploration game.

The project has expanded into including other kinds of translations as well, most of which have some relationship with AI generation. AI is also used as a tool to generate content (pictures and voice over landscapes).
